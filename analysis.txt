They have just won 2 games and are looking out of sorts especially when chasing. They need to perform better and knowing Dhoni and Chennai, they won't give up without a fight and will come back stronger. Hyderabad, on the other hand, have performed well but their last loss against Rajasthan might have dented their confidence but they will be happy that they won their earlier game against Chennai and they will take that confidence into this one. They are unlikely to make any changes to their line-up but will hope that they put in a better performance. So, all-in-all, it promises to be an exciting clash.",null,null,0]
